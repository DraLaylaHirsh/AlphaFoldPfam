Introduction
************

Profiles can help to identify different types of proteins in a particular database.

In this case we present the process for the creation of profiles for repeat proteins, to do so, some programs, datasets, and scripts are needed.

In this documentation we present all the information that will allow you to create your own profiles.

In the section :doc:`Requirements` you will find the :ref:`instructions` for the installing and download.

There is data that you might need, you can find the links from where you can download them in the section :doc:`Usefulllinks`.

   This document was created during a REFRACT secondment made by Layla Hirsh at Andrey Kajava's laboratory 
   This project is under active development.
