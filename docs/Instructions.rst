Instructions
============
In this material you will identify a set of PFAM families from a list given by Andrey Kajava. 
For each PFAM family you will find:
PFAM code
Description 
A link to Interpro protein family information

Then you will find a sequence or more than one representative sequence, usually the diference between one and other is the length or the model.
For each of these protein sequences you will find: 
Interpro sequence information link
Sequence
Results from MRF
Results from TAPASS ( cvs information and in some cases the web images)
Alphafold model using spectrum b given by pymol (red better quality)
Alphafold model using spectrum b given by pymol but with the MRF repeat units painted in magenta and purple
Alpha fold results link (the pdb or the zip file)
